## Uncertainties in palaeoecology

<br>

_palaeoecological data are subject to uncertainties that arise from environmental processes, field and laboratory methods, and data processing, and that affects inferences drawn from them_

## The problem

<br>

Proxy data are the product of multiple sources of uncertainty

- Environmental processes

  - bioturbation, taphonomy, variable sedimentation rates...

- Field and laboratory methods

  - core collection methods, sub-sampling strategy, pollen counting...

- Data processing methods

  - age-depth modelling, interpolation...


## The question: is the past recoverable from the data?

### Why it matters

- Palaeoecology moving from descriptive to quantitative

- Palaeoecology to inform the future requires robust statistical approaches

- Advances in lab methods, data availability, and statistics are making more inferences possible

### What we can do about it

- One method to assess uncertainties is in simulation

::::

## Approach and take-home

<br>

- Simulate core samples containing proxies that mimic the statistical properties of empirical data

- Simulate uncertainties: process and observer error that affect the data

- Assess how *statistical inferences* are affected by those uncertainties


## Key concepts

<br>

- Virtual ecology [@zurell2010]

- Proxy system modelling [@evans2013]

- Pseudoproxy experiments [@mann2002]

## Virtual ecology

<br>

Virtual ecology is a framework for assessing sampling and analytical methods in simulation consisting of:

1. an ecological model that generates synthetic data

    1a. a degradation model

2. a simulated observational process (a sampling model) that samples the synthetic data

3. an analytical process or statistical model applied to both sets of data

4. an assessment of the results



## Virtual ecology and empirical ecology

#### Perfect knowledege, imperfect world

- known drivers and responses

- known environmental and observational processes

- Advantage of benchmark/control data

- Advantage of replication

- Able to systematically introduce uncertainty

## Proxy system modelling

<br>

Describes the process by which environmental change is recorded as an observable signal in an archive:

1. environmental drivers (e.g., climatic variability)

2. a sensor (a physical, biological or chemical component of the system that responds to the environmental drivers)

3. an archive (the medium in which the response of the sensor is recorded such as a lake sediment)

4. observations drawn from the archive

## Pseudoproxy experiments

<br>

Borrowing the term "*pseudoproxies*" from climatology:

- pseudoproxies are simulated data or modified observational data

- mimic the statistical properties of empirical data

- pseudoproxy experiments are similar to virtual ecology
